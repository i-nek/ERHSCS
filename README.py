# Showcase GPA Calculator https://www.calculator.net/gpa-calculator.html
# 
# 1. Ask how we can represent the Courses and their point value (their grade)
# 2. How one's GPA is calculated (the formula)
#
# More info:
# Highschool classes are 1 credit each
# Point scale based on grade (A = 4.0 | B = 3.0 | C = 2.0 | D = 1.0 | F = 0.0)
#
# 3. Write down the formula
# 4. Ask how do we display the GPA
# 
# Extended (How can we improve):
#  
# Iteration 1:
# 
# Using the keyword Input():
# Actually makes the program interactive
# 
# Iteration 2:
#
# Loops (why? | Well to remove redundency from the code such as the 4 variables/inputs)
# Casting (why? | Well you can't divide a number by a string or a word ex. 4 / one, you cant divide by a word)
# 
# Iteration 3 (may or may not do):
# 
# Try-Except Block (maybe? | A Try-Except block is used to test code as implied by the keyword, Try and except means if the code errors in any way)
# Basic conditionals (if statements)
# 
# Checks (why? | Well one can't assume the user will input what you(the server) would want so you want to handle those and plan accordingly)
